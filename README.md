How to get a real public link (two quick options)
-----------------------------------------------

1) GitHub Pages (free, simple)
- Create a GitHub repo (e.g. `portfolio`).
- Upload the file `portfolio.html` to the repository root (and optionally `resume.pdf`).
- In repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch root. GitHub will publish at:
  `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
- If you name the HTML file `index.html` (recommended) and place it on the repo root or in `docs/`, the URL will show the page directly.

2) Netlify (drag-and-drop, instant link)
- Go to netlify.com, sign up, and use "Sites" → "New site from Git" (connect GitHub) or the drag-and-drop deploy (just drop the `portfolio.html` file).
- Netlify gives you a random subdomain (changeable) like `https://clever-name.netlify.app`.

Tips to customize
- Replace `you@example.com`, `LinkedIn`, and `GitHub` links with your real links.
- Change the "Projects" URLs to your live demos or repo URLs.
- Rename `portfolio.html` to `index.html` before publishing for the cleanest result.

If you want, I can:
- Personalize this page with your name, bio, and project details.
- Convert it into a multi-page site or React app.
- Produce `index.html` + optimized images + a ready-to-upload zip.

What's next
-----------
Tell me the exact name, short bio (1–2 sentences), email, GitHub and LinkedIn links, and 2–3 project entries (title, 1-line description, and live/demo link) and I'll personalize everything and produce a final zip you can upload.
